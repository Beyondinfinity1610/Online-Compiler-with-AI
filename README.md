# Online Compiler with AI Guidance: "Code Buddy"

Welcome to **Code Buddy**, your friendly neighborhood online compiler that doesn’t just execute your code but also thinks alongside you! Forget those boring, robotic assistants, we’re here to make coding fun and engaging.

## 🚀 What’s the Idea?

Code Buddy is designed for beginner coders who might feel a bit lost in the vast sea of syntax and logic. Our AI buddy helps you identify your mistakes and nudges you toward the right path without just handing over the answers on a silver platter. Think of us as your coding Yoda minus the green skin and Jedi powers.

## 🛠️ Built Using

- **Monaco Editor API**
  
- **Piston API** 

- **Google Gemini AI API**

## 🛠️ Improvements Needed

⚠️ **Still under Construction**

- **AI Response Parsing**: It's kinda trash right now 🥲, soon will fix it.

- **Color-Coded Output**: Errors, warnings, and success messages will soon be displayed in dazzling colors, making it easier to spot what went wrong (or right!).

## 🛠️ What’s Next?

- **Login Features**: Support for both email and google auth.

- **Code Storage & Retrieval**: Save your masterpieces for future reference (or to cringe at later).

- **AI Model Selection**: Soon, you’ll be able to choose between multiple AI models for code analysis, so you can pick your favorite style of guidance.
  
- **AI Buddy Character Selection**: In the future, you'll be able to choose a character that you want to be as your buddy.


**Note**: No actual buddies were harmed in the making of this project. All AI responses are purely fictional and meant to guide you on your coding journey!
